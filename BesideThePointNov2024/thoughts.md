Given the two points, the locus of points equidistance from them is perpendicular bisector of them.

If this line crosses the side closest to the blue point, then magic!

Otherwise... no magic. 

Note, this should be symmetric, i.e., the blue point can be set within one triangle (formed by the diaganols), and the red point anywhere in the square.
